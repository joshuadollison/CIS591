    "# Questions to consider\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Why do so many introductions to coding languages begin with print statements?\n",
    "    * e.g. print(\"Hello World!\")\n",
    "  \n",
    "    <div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\">\n",
    "    Thoughts * gpt\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Immediate Feedback\n",
    "  \n",
    "        * Printing to the screen is the simplest way to show the student that the code actually did something.\n",
    "        * No setup, no extra tools—just “write this line, run it, and see the output.”\n",
    "    \t* This gives instant gratification, which helps beginners feel successful right away.\n",
    "     \n",
    "    2. Minimal Complexity\n",
    "  \n",
    "        * It introduces only the bare minimum syntax needed in the language:\n",
    "        \t* keywords (like print)\n",
    "        \t* strings (\"Hello World!\")\n",
    "        \t* parentheses or semicolons (depending on the language)\n",
    "    \t* No variables, no loops, no imports—just one concept at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Historical Tradition\n",
    "  \n",
    "       * The practice dates back to Brian Kernighan’s “Hello, World!” example in the book The C Programming Language (1978).\n",
    "    \t* That book became foundational, and other language authors copied the pattern.\n",
    "    \t* Over time, “Hello, World!” became a rite of passage in programming culture.\n",
    "  \n",
    "    4. Universality\n",
    "   \n",
    "    \t* Every language—Python, C, Java, Rust, etc.—can display text in some way.\n",
    "    \t* Starting with printing provides a common ground for learners across languages.\n",
    "    \t* It makes it easier to compare languages (“this is how you say hello in C, this is how in Python”).\n",
    "\n",
    "    5. Gateway to Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "    - From print(\"Hello World!\"), it’s an easy progression to:\n",
    "        * Printing variables → understanding data types\n",
    "        * Printing results of calculations → expressions & operators\n",
    "    \t* Printing in loops → control flow\n",
    "    \t* Formatting output → strings and functions\n",
    "      \n",
    "2. What's the big deal about seeing a collection of words displayed directly below a code cell where those same words are included in a print request?\n",
    "3. How do practitioners use print() statements in the real world?\n",
    "4. How do I handle complext print statements?  \n",
    "    > - e.g. when statements include apostraphes\n",
    "    > - long statements that need multiple lines\n",
    "    > - situations where I want to incorporate dynamic information?"
